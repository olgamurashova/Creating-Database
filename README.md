## Creating-Database

### General information

When creating database, we start with designing a database schema that  is documentation that helps its audience such as a database designer, administrator and other users interact with a database. The information in the database is organized into tables. A database table is made up of columns of information. Each column is assigned a name and data type. After creating database tables, we create relationships between tables by designating certain columns of a database table as keys. Keys place constraints on the data in a table to maintain data integrity. 

Below is an example of querying the ```information_schema.key_column_usage``` view to validate the existence of a primary key in the tables:
